# 0.0.0 First Commit
# 1.0.0 Add Files
# 1.0.1 Code improvement in Handler.Transform
- Added code so that the Handler.Transform behavior is updated in edit mode and Play mode of the Unity Editor
## Needs to be checked
- The ASPax attributes have lost effect due to the code update. It is necessary to check and correct, if possible and viable. If not, remove the unusable ASPax attributes.
